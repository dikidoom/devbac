# Job

calculate (projected) blood alcohol concentration for a known number of people with (known or averaged) body weight given a specific (known volume and alcohol concentration) bottle of spirit.

# Research

## Formula

From [this website](http://www.ctduiattorney.com/calculating-bac/) we gleam that

```%BAC = (A x 5.14/W x r) â€“ .015 x H```

where

- `%BAC` is current blood alcohol concentration in *percent*
- `A` is liquid *ounces* of alcohol ingested
- `W` is body weight in *pounds*
- `r` is a 'distribution rate' (.73 for men, .66 for women)
- `H` is time passed since ingestion in *hours*
- `5.14` is a conversion factor
  incorporating liquid ounces to ounces of weight, pound to ounces, and percentage

### Refinement

`us-dot.txt` describes a refined method for calculation found [in the wayback machine](http://web.archive.org/web/20060930091559/http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/alcohol/bacreport.html).

## Notes

- 1 kilogram = 2.205 pounds
- 1 ounce = 29.574 millilitres

# Plan

## Features

The calculation appears straightforward (minus metric conversion). But what kind of features would be nice *besides* calculating *single* ingestions?

- graphs
- consider multiple ingestions
  in timed intervals
- group dynamics
  enter # of people, average weight (or list of weights), # of ingestions, average alcohol content, interval ...
  get projected drunkness graph
- gui for displaying graphs
  and fast adjustment of parameters
- social features, e.g. online?

## Future

- collect metrics of individual intoxication (how?)
  feed back into calculation (anonymously)

# To Do

- Read `us-dot.txt`
- Decide which framework or pl currently tickles our fancy
